(* Handling of the names of compilation units, including associated "-for-pack"
   prefixes.

   By "compilation unit" we mean the code and data associated with the
   compilation of a single .ml source file: that is to say, file-level
   entities having OCaml semantics.  The notion neither includes the special
   "startup" files nor external libraries.
