(* Continuation use. A continuation can be translated one of two ways:
   - by a static jump (Cmm jump, using a unique integer)
   - by inlining the continuation's body at the call site. *)

type cont =
  | Jump of { types: Cmm.machtype list; cont: int; }

(* Delayed let-bindings. Let bindings are delayed in stages in order
   to allow for potential reordering and inlining of variables that are bound
   and used exactly once, (without changing semantics), in order to optimize
   the generated cmm code. There are two main optimizations that are
   targeted : arithmetic optimization of nested expressions (mainly
   tagging/untagging), and potential optimizations performed later on
   function applications which work better when arguments are not
   let-bound. Non-linear let bindings are also delayed to allow linear
   let-bound vars to be permuted with non-linear let-bound vars.

   Let-bound variables can be one of three kinds: pure, coeffect and effect
   (effectful variables can also have coeffects).
   Pure let-bound variables are simply added to the environment usual map.
   Effectful and coeffectful variables are organised into stages:
   a stage is either:
   - a serie of consecutive bindings with only coeffects
   - a single effectful binding
   Whenever a new binding that doesn't match the current stage is added,
   the current stage is archived, and replaced by a new stage.
   Only bindings in the current stage are candidates to inlining.
   When inlined, a binding is removed from its stage (as only linear
   bindings are supposed to be inlined), and if the current stage becomes
   empty, the last archived stage is "un-archived".
