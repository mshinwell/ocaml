Things in Closure that we still need to implement, + others:

- Fix the Flambda 2.0 inlining size calculation
- More primitives: 
  - Block load for float records
  - String_or_bigstring load in the string case?
  - Array_length for the non-value cases
  - String_length
  - Int_arith unary    ]
  - Float_arith unary  ] should have code for these
  - Num_conv unary     ]
  - Boolean_not unary  ]
- Implement loading/saving for .cmx files (including reachability analysis)
- Make sure that reify deals with all the cases for boxed numbers, etc.
  so that these get lifted.

Remaining other parts:

- Move Prepare_lambda into Cps_conversion - Pierre on it
- Finish new "let rec" translation - posted upstream
- Make sure Flambda_to_cmm does everything we need from the old Cmmgen code
  that won't be run any more -- Vincent says there's a fair amount here
- Merge in backend exceptions patches - Vincent on it
- Implement functionality to add to the backtrace buffer?  Not sure how much
  other bookkeeping this needs, to determine what to add.
