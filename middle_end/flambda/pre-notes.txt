PDCE

- predicate on primitives
- no coeffects, at most generative effects
- these things can be delayed and removed
- delay as late as possible but no later than first existing use
- at a fork point, push everywhere, but the end result will be that
on branches where the prim isn't needed, just won't be there
- join: propagate: var = prim assuming that exists for all params.
We need to make sure the simples used to build the primitives are
also propagated - a bit like the unboxing.  Need to add new parameters.
CSE params are also like this.
- thus far it duplicates things
- so, need to insert them at first point where they are totally anticipated
- upwards propagation based on uses
- join on the way up (i.e. a fork): if only used down one side, need to
add another continuation to bounce through.
- maybe simple usage of var tracking on the way up is sufficient
(incl cont parameters).
