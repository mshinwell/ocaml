(** Middle-end symbols: names of statically-allocated constants.  These
    symbols are used inside Closure and Flambda.  They always point at
    well-formed OCaml values in a data section, never at code, with the
    exception of those symbols created with [for_function].

    Middle-end symbols should in general not be created later than the middle
    end. The infrastructure for these symbols relies on a current compilation
    unit being set, which might not always be the case later on, e.g. when
    compiling a startup file.
