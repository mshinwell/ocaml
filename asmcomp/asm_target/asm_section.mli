    Aside: Why do we need labels at the start of sections rather than
    just referencing sections directly?
    They are necessary so that references (e.g. DW_FORM_ref_addr or
    DW_FORM_sec_offset when emitting DWARF) to places that are currently
    at the start of these sections get relocated correctly when those
    places become not at the start (e.g. during linking). *)
