(** Coalesce labels that point at the same source location. This avoids
    generating DWARF information that appears to reference different ranges of
    code but actually points at the same place. In particular, generating
    duplicate lexical blocks at the same position causes some of their local
    variables to become hidden in gdb. This pass also produces tidier assembly
    output.
