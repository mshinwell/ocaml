(** Coalesce labels that point at the same source location.  This maximises
    the chance that two labels which actually point at the same location can
    be identified as doing so by using a simple equality check.  This helps
    in particular with constructing the DWARF-5 .debug_addr section.

    This pass also rewrites all labels that are defined by [Llabel]
    constructs in the code so that they are in increasing order by code
    address.  (So in particular this excludes [call_labels] and so forth.)
    This rewriting is necessary so that the code used to construct DWARF-4
    location lists can use the ordering between labels as a proxy for
    the ordering between the corresponding virtual memory addresses.
*)
(* CR mshinwell: It's not clear the second paragraph above is true, since
   maybe that code only looks at the labels inserted by [Compute_ranges],
   which are in order. *)
