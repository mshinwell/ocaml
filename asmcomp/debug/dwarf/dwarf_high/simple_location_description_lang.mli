(** Higher-level representation of simple location descriptions than that
    provided by the DWARF standard.  This representation is compiled down
    to [Simple_location_description.t] values.

    Functions in this interface are used to build descriptions that enable
    the debugger to know what value a particular variable has at runtime.
    This is done by either giving the value itself ("rvalue" semantics) or
    explaining how to compute the address in the target's memory where the
    value may be found ("lvalue" semantics).  Which of these semantics is
    appropriate depends on the context in which the simple location
    description is being used.  (For example see the DWARF-4 standard
    section 2.6.1.1.3 bullet point 2.)

    The descriptions of the functions are written in terms of some fictional
    value V and time T.  The time is when the simple location description is
    being evaluated in the debugger to inspect V.
